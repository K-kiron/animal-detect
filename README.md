# Animal classification and detection-ViT
IFT 3710/6759 H23 - Projets (avanc√©s) en apprentissage automatique

This project proposes a set of general ideas and data sets all around the topic of animal classification and detection from photos. Images of animals are interesting because they constitute a valuable test bed and benchmark for computer vision models and, at the same time, improving the performance of such models on the task of animal classification and detection has the potential of facilitating the work of life scientists.

Using data:
Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) is a dataset for the comparative evaluation of transfer learning algorithms, such as attribute-based classification and learning from scratch. AwA2 is a direct replacement for the original Animals with Attributes (AwA) dataset, with more images published for each category. AwA2 also provides a category-attribute matrix, which contains an 85-dim attribute vector (e.g. colour, stripes, fur, size and habitat) for each category.
-37322 images
-50 animal categories

This project aimed at evaluating the performance of Vision Transformer (ViT) models on a smaller dataset and with a limited training time. ViT models have gained a reputation for their remarkable performance on various computer vision tasks, but they require significant computational resources to train. The primary goal of this project was to investigate whether ViT models can still deliver competitive results under more constrained conditions.
